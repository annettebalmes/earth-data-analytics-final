Grassland Management Under Climate Change 
- Evaluation of Sorghastrum nutans likelihood in several regions

## Introduction
Sorghastrum nutans, commonly known as Indiangrass, is a warm-season perennial grass native to North America, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. It is often found in prairies, savannas, and open woodlands, and is found from the east coast to the Rocky Mountains, Arizona, Wyoming, and Utah.

Fast Facts
* It grows from 3 to 8 feet tall
*Indiangrass has a medium tolerance
to salinity and drought
*It usually
occurs in non-wetlands, but may occur in wetlands
* It's roots can grow to a depth of 2 meters.

## Data Choice
If we analyze different types of data like pH, slope, and precipitation inputted into a fuzzly logic model can help us find the areas most suitable for Indiangrass to occur.

We can find Indiangrass by looking at it's soecific characteristics:
* pH range of 4.8 to 8.0
* middle and lower slopes from 10 - 40%
* annual precipitation of 28 to 114 cm

We can aquire that data from:
* pH: soil depth 100-200 cm pH data from POLARIS
* slope: APPEEARS API for elevation data from NASA Earthdata
* annual precipitation: MACAv2 dataset, accessible from Climate Toolbox.

## Locations to Test out my Model

According to the USDA, Indiangrass occurs as a dominant or subdominant in the following
classifications:
     
Composition, classification and species response patterns of remnant
   tallgrass prairies in Texas.
Classification of native vegetation at the Woodworth Station, North
   Dakota.

With access to the USFS National Grassland Units, I found two locations in these areas where I knew Indiangrass was very likely to occur.
1. Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland, Texas, USA.
2. Sheynne National Grassland, North Dakota, USA.
