Grassland Management Under Climate Change 
- Evaluation of Sorghastrum nutans likelihood in several regions

- Written Analysis: On my personal github webpage: https://annettebalmes.github.io/

## Introduction
Sorghastrum nutans, commonly known as Indiangrass, is a warm-season perennial grass native to North America, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. It is often found in prairies, savannas, and open woodlands, and is found from the east coast to the Rocky Mountains, Arizona, Wyoming, and Utah (Michigan Natural Features Inventory, n.d.).

If we analyze different types of data like pH, slope, and precipitation inputted into a fuzzly logic model can help us find the areas most suitable for Indiangrass to occur, the code within the final_code folder will do just that.

## How to run the code

1. Check for all imports to be set up in your environment
2. If you want to use the AppEARS API, uncomment the first download_elevation function, and comment the second/repeat. If you want to use the .tif files that I manually downloaded and uploaded to the final_code folder, just make sure they are in the correct respoitory
3. Press Run All

If you would like to change the grassland:
* You will need to copy and paste throughout the notebook. The two that I did are always right on top of each other, so it should be easy enough to track. In the future, I will plan on making better and more fluid functions to ease this process, and even make it less specific to grasslands.
